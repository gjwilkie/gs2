GS2 TRUNK STATUS - please see NOTES at end
----------------

r1571:   Completes cleanup by Dorland.  Removed lots of obsolete features
         comprising a few thousand lines of code.  Some changes required 
         for some old namelists to work.  The most important changes were:

         *  Removed the option to define vt == sqrt(T/m) b/c it was costing 
            people too much time to understand and track down associated
            errors.  From now on, vt == sqrt(2 T / m).  

      	 *  Removed the option to use old energy grids.  Only option now 
            is to use the grid that Michael and Tomo worked out.  Was
            selected by "vgrid= .true." in the past and is now automatic.
            This is a change of the default behavior.  The variable 'ecut'
            should not appear in the input file.  Specify vcut instead.
            For the most part, vcut = sqrt(ecut) for backwards compatibility.

NOTES
-----

This file is intended to give some indication of the usability of the
trunk at different revision numbers. To answer the question "Which revision
should I be using?" the most useful information is likely to be the status of
the current revision, and if that is broken or unknown then the number of the
most recent revision at which the status is thought to have been OK.

This information could create a path towards a new tagged "release" version,
if it helps to establish stably a recent revision that is essentially OK.
The "release" could be obtained by backing out any new physics
developments (but not bug-fixes) since that revision.

Ideally, "release" versions would be used for publishable results and by users
who are not GS2 developers.
