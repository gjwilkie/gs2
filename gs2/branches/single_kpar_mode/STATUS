NOTES
-----

This file is intended to give some indication of the usability of the
trunk at different revision numbers. To answer the question "Which revision
should I be using?" the most useful information is likely to be the status of
the current revision, and if that is broken or unknown then the number of the
most recent revision at which the status is thought to have been OK.

This information could create a path towards a new tagged "release" version,
if it helps to establish stably a recent revision that is essentially OK.
The "release" could be obtained by backing out any new physics
developments (but not bug-fixes) since that revision.

Ideally, "release" versions would be used for publishable results and by users
who are not GS2 developers.
