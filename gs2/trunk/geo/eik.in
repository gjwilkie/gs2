To check for ideal ballooning stability:

1. choose radius, rhoc = rho,    0 < rho < 1

2. choose definition of rho:
   irho = 2    : d/D
   irho = 3    : Psi_normalized
   irho = 1    : sqrt(toroidal flux) normalized

3. Set bishop = 7
 
4. Choose how many values of beta' to examine: nbeta = this number

5. Examine range of beta' values around the equilibrium value, from 
   beta' = beta'_equilibrium / beta_prime_over to 
   beta' = beta'_equilibrium * beta_prime_times

   (i.e., set beta_prime_over and beta_prime_times)

   Typical values: 
 
   nbeta = 21
   beta_prime_times = 2.
   beta_prime_over = 2.

6. Choose nperiod, ntheta.  Typical: nperiod = 5, ntheta = 128

The following rarely change:

7. Set big = 1, iflux = 1  

8. Set isym = 0, equal_arc = .false., ismooth = 0


Output to screen:  

First column is d beta / d rho that was used for the analysis.
Second column is either 0 or not.  
   0 => stable to ideal ballooning
   otherwise => unstable to ideal ballooning

Nothing else really matters. 



NOTE: You may need to know what the nominal value of beta' = d beta/d
rho is for this radius.  This can be found by running eiktest with the
same input file, except bishop = 1.  The result is written to the
screen.
